VentTag builds upon Spotify by allowing users to add hashtags to actual Spotify songs. Using Spotify's API, we acquired user's playlists and displayed it onto the screen, allowing users to add hashtags as they please. Users now can create new playlists with their hashtagged songs and playlists. This makes new ways to store and share music. Vent Tag uses Parse to store the songs specific to that hashtag depending on which user has logged in. This was the first project Vent Origins worked on and was not the last.
